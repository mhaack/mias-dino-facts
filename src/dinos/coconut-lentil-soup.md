Peel 1 onion and chop. Smash 6 garlic cloves with the flat side of your knife. Peel, then finely chop. Peel the ginger with a small spoon, then finely chop.

Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in large Dutch oven over medium. Add onion and cook, stirring often, just until translucent, 6â€“8 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring often, until garlic is starting to turn golden, about 5 minutes. Add 5 tsp. curry powder and 0.5 tsp. cayenne and cook, stirring constantly, until spices are aromatic and starting to stick to bottom of pot, about 1 minute. Add the coconut milk and stir to loosen spices, then stir in the lentils, the shredded coconut, 2 tsp. salt, and 1 liter of water.

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low to keep soup at a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lentils are broken down and soup is thickened, 25â€“30 minutes.

Meanwhile, coarsely chop the spinach. Add spinach and the tomatoes to pot and stir to combine. Taste and season with more salt. Simmer just to let flavors meld, about 5 minutes. Taste and season again with more salt.

Ladle soup into bowls. Top with yogurt, if desired.
